## Overview
This project is designed to automate the process of starting and stopping data collection via email commands. It consists of a main Python script that monitors email inbox for specific commands, and a secondary script responsible for sending periodic data collection notifications.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Access to an email account (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
Additional Python packages: imaplib, email, smtplib, time

## Setup
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip:

Once these packages have been installed, you may begin by running the Start&Stop_Program.py file. This script can be modified to handle starting and stopping any process using the emailing system.
